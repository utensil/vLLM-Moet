# DeepSeek‑V4‑Flash on Blackwell (SM120)

**Official vLLM v0.24.0 + a 5.6k‑line patch** that (a) makes DeepSeek‑V4‑Flash (159B MoE)
actually run on consumer/workstation Blackwell — the release is broken‑as‑shipped for DS4 on
SM120 — and (b) fits it on hardware the FP4 checkpoint can't reach, by compressing the experts
to **2 bits** with **FP4 recovery**, on hand‑written SM120 SASS kernels. At the extreme end
the 2‑bit base itself moves to host RAM and the GPU becomes an **expert cache** — which puts
the 159B model on **a single RTX 5090**.

## What you get

Official DeepSeek‑V4‑Flash checkpoint, 2‑bit experts + FP4 delta cache, MTP k=2, CUDA graphs
(single‑stream medians; prefill = 8k‑token prompt, uncached; 2026‑07‑09):

| hardware | decode | prefill 8k | context |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **1× RTX PRO 6000 (96 GB)** | **161 tok/s** | **5 340 tok/s** | **512K** |
| **2× RTX PRO 6000 (TP2)** | **210 tok/s** | **5 790 tok/s** (pre‑AFRAG) | 512K |
| **4× RTX 5090 (TP4)** | **214 tok/s** | **6 100 tok/s** | 16K+ |
| **1× RTX 5090 (32 GB)** | **~38 tok/s** (MTP + host‑resident base, see below) | — | 8K |

**Batched serving** (aggregate decode tok/s at N concurrent streams; per‑stream in
parentheses at N=32):

| concurrency | 1 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1× RTX PRO 6000 | 156 | 290 | 493 | 659 | **933** (29/stream) |
| 4× RTX 5090 (TP4) | 198 | 460 | 762 | 1 006 | **1 560** (49/stream) |

Four consumer 5090s match two PRO 6000s on decode. MTP acceptance ~2.6 tok/step across all
configs. **512K on one card is live-validated**: needle retrieval PASS at 102K / 256K / 453K
prompt tokens (depths 0.1 and 0.5; cold TTFT at 453K ≈ 2 min). Methodology:
**[docs/v024-port.md](docs/v024-port.md)**.

A 96 GB card cannot even load the official checkpoint (FP4 experts + FP8 dense ≈ 149 GiB);
here it serves it at 161 tok/s with the full 512K window.

## How it fits — 2‑bit experts at FP4 quality

We compress **only the routed experts** to 2 bits (dense stays FP8) and recover FP4 precision
adaptively:

- **2‑bit expert planes — the sign‑bias finding.** Naive 2‑bit *destroys* this model
  (degenerate loops). The cause is **sign asymmetry**, not error magnitude — the optimal‑L2
  codebook drops one sign's tail and the per‑expert bias compounds over 43 layers. Forcing a
  **sign‑symmetric** `{−4,−1,1,4}` codebook at the same L2 error fixes it entirely (33,023 of
  33,024 tensors pick it), landing MTP acceptance **at/above** the FP4 experts (2.73 ≥ 2.68 in
  the original QUANT_PROBE study; ~2.6 reproduced on the v0.24 base). The finding also
  reproduces on **GLM‑5.2** (180‑tensor sweep: asym bias −0.042, 99% negative; symmetric 392×
  smaller at equal rel‑RMS) — see below.
- **FP4 recovery — used surgically.** Decode is HBM‑bound and an FP4 read is 2× the bytes, so
  2‑bit is the *fast* default: a **delta cache** keeps the hot experts at FP4 (background
  promote/evict thread, CUDA‑graph‑safe), and a **confidence gate** (`VLLM_MOE_W2_GATE=1`)
  re‑runs low‑confidence tokens at FP4 — force‑promote the step's routed experts, replay the
  graph once, re‑decide. Works inline on TP/single‑GPU (incl. MTP verify steps) and as a
  full‑pipeline replay under PP; τ tunable at runtime. Arming it costs ~10% single‑stream;
  the τ=0.60 replays were throughput‑neutral on top (FP4 re‑decides lift MTP acceptance).
- **The kernels.** `moe_w2_mm` (2‑bit MoE GEMM: PRMT‑LUT in‑register decode → `QMMA.SF`
  block‑scaled tensor cores, 4 CTA/SM) and `moe_w4_mm` (FP4 delta GEMM) — hand‑written SASS,
  shipped as sources + prebuilt cubins for every sharding (K = 6144/4096/2048/1024/512), so
  TP2/TP4 work out of the box. Op‑validated (rel ~1–3e‑3, deterministic), graph‑capture‑exact.
  Prefill runs the **AFRAG** variant (fragment‑major activations → one `LDG.128` per QMMA
  A‑fragment; the prefill GEMM is load‑issue‑bound, not DRAM‑bound): bit‑identical outputs,
  1.3× on the GEMM, **+12% e2e prefill** on one card — default on (`VLLM_MOE_W2_AFRAG=0`
  opts out).

Both checkpoint flavors are supported: **FP4 experts** (DeepSeek‑V4‑Flash — codes remap at
load) and **FP8 block‑quant experts** (Flash‑Base, **GLM‑5.2‑FP8** — re‑quantized to the
sign‑symmetric codebook at load, float64‑exact vs the reference pipeline).

## 159B on one RTX 5090 — the GPU as an expert cache

The 2‑bit planes of DeepSeek‑V4‑Flash total **72.7 GiB** — 2.3× the VRAM of an RTX 5090.
`VLLM_MOE_W2_BASE_CACHE_GB=N` inverts the residency: the **whole 2‑bit base lives in pinned
host RAM**, and the GPU holds only the FP8 dense stack, KV, and an N‑GiB **cache of hot
experts** (same slot‑table machinery as the delta tier, read inside CUDA graphs; background
prefetch keeps it converged to the routed working set). MoE routing turns out to be
concentrated enough to make this practical: **19% coverage serves ~96% of token→expert
routings** once warm (89% on GLM‑5.2 at 20% coverage — measured live, not simulated).

Misses cannot be served from anything resident, so correctness comes from the same replay
trick the confidence gate uses: the desc kernel zeroes a missing expert's contribution and
bumps an in‑graph miss counter; the runner then fetches **all** missing routed experts in one
batched pinned‑H2D transfer (51.6 GiB/s on this box; a 64‑expert fetch is ~3 ms) and replays
the step's graph once — the replay is **bit‑identical** to a fully resident forward
(unit‑tested). Prefill prefetches its per‑layer working set up front instead.

Result on **1× RTX 5090 (32 GB)**: dense FP8 + an 11–14 GiB pool (19% of experts) on GPU,
72.7 GiB pinned host RAM, CUDA graphs on, coherent greedy output — **~38 tok/s** steady
decode with MTP k=2 (~32 without; acceptance 2.83 — the miss replay covers MTP verify steps
too), 10–24 tok/s while the working set shifts (miss replays). Not a speed demon — a
**capacity unlock**: the model this card cannot even hold now runs on it, and the same knob
is the path to GLM‑5.2 (753B) on two 96 GB cards, where the pool covers ~58% of experts and
misses become rare.

## The base: vLLM v0.24.0 on SM120

Upstream v0.24.0 ships DeepSeek‑V4 + SM120 natively — but the release cannot actually serve
DS4 on SM120. The patch carries the fixes (details in
[docs/v024-port.md](docs/v024-port.md)):

- **DeepGEMM**: release pin has no family‑120 host paths ("Unknown SF transformation",
  einsum/indexer asserts) → pin **nv‑dev `a6b593d2`** (as vLLM main did).
- **flashinfer**: official 0.6.12 pin predates the SM120 DS4 attention API → **0.6.14**.
- `cooperative_topk` uses thread‑block **cluster launch** (SM90/100‑only) → gated off on SM12x.
- o_proj fp8 einsum: SM100 packed scale layout NaNs on SM120 → SM90‑style raw f32 scales.
- CUDA‑graph capture: `thread_local` error mode on **all four** capture paths (the delta
  cache's background thread must not invalidate capture).

With the 2‑bit knobs off, the patch is exactly these base fixes — stock behaviour otherwise.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kacper-daftcode/vLLM-Moet && cd vLLM-Moet

# official vllm-openai:v0.24.0 image + patch + pins + SM120 cubins
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f Dockerfile.sm120-v024 -t vllm-moet-sm120:v024 .
```

Serve (single 96 GB card, production knobs — same as the benchmark config):

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus '"device=0"' --network host --ipc host --shm-size 64g \
  -v /path/to/DeepSeek-V4-Flash:/model:ro \
  -e VLLM_MOE_W2=1 -e VLLM_MOE_W2_DELTA_GB=1 \
  vllm-moet-sm120:v024 \
  --model /model --served-model-name deepseek-v4-flash --trust-remote-code \
  --kv-cache-dtype fp8 --block-size 256 --max-model-len 24576 \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.95 --max-num-batched-tokens 1024 --max-num-seqs 4 \
  --tokenizer-mode deepseek_v4 --no-scheduler-reserve-full-isl \
  --speculative-config '{"method": "deepseek_mtp", "num_speculative_tokens": 2}' \
  --compilation-config '{"cudagraph_mode":"FULL_AND_PIECEWISE","custom_ops":["all"]}' \
  --port 8000
```

`VLLM_MOE_W2=0` = stock FP4 path (needs ≥2 cards). TP: add `--tensor-parallel-size 2|4` and
`--disable-custom-all-reduce`. Confidence gate: `-e VLLM_MOE_W2_GATE=1`
(+ optional `VLLM_MOE_W2_GATE_TAU`). `VLLM_MOE_W2_DELTA_GB=auto` sizes the FP4 pool from
the VRAM left after KV allocation (0 at extreme context, ~1.6 GiB at 24K — no manual
delta-vs-KV bookkeeping; see [docs/v024-port.md](docs/v024-port.md)).

Single‑5090 (host‑resident base): swap the delta knobs for
`-e VLLM_MOE_W2_BASE_CACHE_GB=11 -e VLLM_MOE_W2_DELTA_GB=0` and use
`--max-model-len 8192 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.90 --max-num-seqs 2` (needs ~80 GiB free
host RAM for the pinned base; MTP works — keep the speculative‑config; PP unsupported on
this path yet).

## Quality

Method: baseline is the untouched official checkpoint; our variant changes only the expert
codes (same stack, byte‑identical dense/scales/headers), so any delta is the quantization
alone — see [docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md). The QUANT_PROBE study (identical quant scheme
and cubins): MTP acceptance 2.73 vs 2.68 FP4 reference, draft accept 86.3% vs 84.1%, 12/12
coherent greedy outputs; bare 2‑bit agrees with FP4 on 89% of next‑token picks — the delta
cache + gate close that gap. Live serving reproduces the acceptance (~2.6 tok/step).

## GLM‑5.2 on 4× RTX PRO 6000

**GLM‑5.2 (753B MoE) serves on 4× RTX PRO 6000 (TP4)** from the official
[nvidia/GLM-5.2-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/GLM-5.2-NVFP4) checkpoint (433 GB): the
loader re‑quantizes modelopt NVFP4 experts (e2m1 × e4m3 block‑16 × per‑tensor scale_2) to the
same sign‑symmetric 2‑bit planes at load — f64‑exact vs the sweep reference on real shards —
and serves through the K=6144/K=512 kernel family. The sign‑symmetric codebook finding
reproduces on GLM‑5.2's weights (`internal` sweep). Measured (single‑stream, greedy,
CUDA graphs; 2026‑07‑09):

| config (TP4, 128K window) | decode | notes |
|---|---:|---|
| 2‑bit base | 56 tok/s | eager: 12 → graphs 4.7× |
| + **MTP** (`{"method":"mtp","num_speculative_tokens":2}`) | **105 tok/s** | acceptance 2.3–2.8, content‑dependent |
| + FP4 delta (auto) + confidence gate τ=0.60 | **83–85 tok/s** | the quality tier: FP4 re‑decides low‑confidence steps |

Prefill ~2.5k tok/s (8–13.5K prompts). Long context, validated by needle retrieval:
**PASS to 126K** on the nvfp4 KV cache and **to 276K** on fp8 (331K window fits at util 0.95);
GLM's nominal 1M window is KV‑bound on 4 cards. Tool calling (`glm47`) and reasoning (`glm45`)
parsers work — the served endpoint drives coding agents (opencode) out of the box.

MTP under **pipeline parallelism** also landed: the patch carries draft‑token propagation +
drafter embedding share across PP ranks — DeepSeek‑V4‑Flash on 4× RTX 5090 **PP4** does
184 tok/s with MTP vs 93 without (~2×), acceptance up to 2.81. Greedy decode under PP is
**bit‑deterministic** (6/6 identical runs with and without MTP) since the bijective‑unpermute
fix.

**NVFP4 KV cache** (`--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4`) packs the SM120 sparse‑MLA KV to **352 B/token**
(vs 656 B `fp8_ds_mla`) — on GLM‑5.2 TP4 that is **+38% KV pool** (415K → 571K tokens at equal
settings) at decode parity, or the freed VRAM goes to the FP4 delta pool (the standing config
runs a 19.6 GiB/GPU pool + 175K‑token KV in 128K windows). See
[docs/v024-port.md](docs/v024-port.md) for this and the other v0.24 additions (deterministic
MoE unpermute, the host‑resident BASE cache, AFRAG prefill).

## The SM120 toolchain we built

These kernels exist only because we first built the assembler and the ISA data they need.
Consumer Blackwell (sm_120) has **no public SASS toolchain**. Current CUDA does expose the
block‑scaled MMA *instruction* itself (PTX `kind::mxf8f6f4` compiles to `QMMA.SF` — DeepGEMM's
SM120 port uses it), but everything these kernels are actually made of — hand scheduling
against measured latencies and control words, the PRMT‑LUT decode interleaved into the QMMA
stream, register‑bank and occupancy shaping (regcount 64 → 4 CTA/SM) — is decided by ptxas
and unreachable from CUDA/PTX. So the stack underneath this repo is end‑to‑end ours:

- **[`blackwell-isa`](https://github.com/kacper-daftcode/blackwell-isa)** — a machine‑readable
  **SM120 SASS ISA database**: 1,994 instruction forms, 128‑bit encoding templates + operand/
  bitfield maps, and per‑opcode scheduling metadata (pipeline/latency/throughput, control‑word
  classes). Reverse‑engineered and hardware‑validated on RTX 5090 (47,244 instructions decoded
  across 178 cubins at 100% coverage; 5,014/5,014 roundtrip‑fuzz). It documents what the CUDA
  toolchain hides — e.g. `QMMA.SF` block‑scaled FP4 MMA and an undocumented `E3M4` type code.
  Ships a [searchable HTML reference](https://kacper-daftcode.github.io/blackwell-isa/SM120_ISA_REFERENCE.html).
- **[`cubit`](https://github.com/kacper-daftcode/cubit)** — an **SM120 SASS assembler/disassembler**
  built on that database. It turns the hand‑written `.sass` sources in `kernels/sass/` into the
  cubins this server loads, and is the only tool needed to rebuild or audit them.

**ISA ([`blackwell-isa`](https://github.com/kacper-daftcode/blackwell-isa)) → assembler
([`cubit`](https://github.com/kacper-daftcode/cubit)) → SASS kernels → this vLLM.** None of the
kernels here can be *written* through stock CUDA on sm_120 — the instructions compile, the
kernels don't; this toolchain is what makes them possible.

## Repository layout
- **`patch/vllm-moet-v0.24.0.patch`** — the delta vs official vLLM `v0.24.0` (32 files,
  +5.6k lines; applies clean on the tag). Goes with the pins above.
- **`Dockerfile.sm120-v024`** — the image: official `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.24.0` + patch + pins +
  cubins.
- **`kernels/`** — SASS (`sass/`) + prebuilt SM120 cubins (`cubins-sm120/`, incl. the K=6144
  GLM‑5.x family) + generators (`gen/`) + `MANIFEST.md`.
- **`docs/v024-port.md`** — the port: pins, SM120 fixes, apply recipe, benchmark methodology.
- **`docs/quality.md`** — quality methodology.
